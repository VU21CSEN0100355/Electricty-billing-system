The "Electricity Billing System" project is a Java-based desktop application that automates the process of calculating and managing electricity bills for customers. It allows users to input electricity consumption data, generate accurate bills, manage customer details, and keep track of payments. The system is designed to streamline the billing process, reduce manual errors, and enhance efficiency.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Java:Core programming language used for developing the application.
Swing:Java's GUI toolkit used for building the user interface, including forms, tables, and the splash screen.
MySQL: Database used for storing customer data, billing records, and other related information.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):* API used to connect the Java application to the MySQL database.
NetBeans/Eclipse: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding, debugging, and testing the application.
iText: Library used to generate PDF versions of the electricity bills.
7. JasperReports: For generating complex reports if required. 

The project begins with a splash screen that introduces the application and loads the necessary resources before navigating to the main dashboard.
